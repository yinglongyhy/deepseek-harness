 * The minimal path ops carrying `after` over `before`, both as the card sees
 * them. Only keys the card observed are named; fields absent from both sides
 * produce no op, which is why edits are path-addressed rather than a rebuilt
 * section.
 * @param base - path of the edited subtree inside the user section.
 * @param before - the subtree as loaded, or undefined when it is new.
 * @param after - the subtree as edited.
 * @returns ordered set/unset ops; empty when nothing changed.
